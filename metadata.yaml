description: 'This little volume is chiefly composed of the rollicking, Bacchanalian
  and ironical songs from Mr. Chesterton''s novel, ""The Flying Inn"", with certain
  additions. Sillince''s drawings have obvious merits, but are far from obvious. The
  vigour, the derision, the sheer comicality are there, plus a lyrical touch that
  shows real understanding. The final drawings epitomise Chesterton''s spirit and
  his work. Contents Include: The Englishman - Wine and Water - The Song Against Grocers
  - The Rolling English Road - The Song of Quoodle - Pioneers, O Pioneers - The Logical
  Vegetarian - ""The Sar.'
